# TBPS-Team6
This is the repository for Year 3 TBPS 2022 team 6

EDIT: Uploaded the datasets from Mitesh. So everyone should be able to use the same relative path in Python when reading the files. If you have downloaded it from Box, I suppose moving it to your local Github folder and modify it so that it matches the one here will prevent a second download (please correct if this is wrong).
